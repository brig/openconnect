# OpenConnect

OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support [Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN](http://www.cisco.com/go/asm).
It has since been ported to support the Juniper SSL VPN (which is now known as [Pulse Connect Secure](https://www.pulsesecure.net/products/connect-secure/)),
and the [Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect SSL VPN](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/features/vpn).

An openconnect VPN server (ocserv), which implements an improved version of the Cisco AnyConnect protocol, has also been written.
You can find it on Gitlab at [https://gitlab.com/openconnect/ocserv](https://gitlab.com/openconnect/ocserv).
